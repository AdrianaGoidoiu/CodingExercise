1. A file consists of a sequence of ASCII characters.
               A sequence of one or more digits followed by a non-digit represents a decimal integer.
               The file includes no negative numbers.
               Write a program to
                               * add all the numbers in the file,
                               * count how many times each ASCII character occurs in the file,
                               * output the result to a file.
               You may assume that the sum of the numbers will not exceed the maximum value of an integer.
                A sample input file and a valid output file are attached.
 
2. Develop programmatic tests or devise a test strategy to adequately test the developed code.
